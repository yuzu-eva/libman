# myal - My Anime Library

My Anime Library is program to manage an anime watchlist, written in C.
I used to track which anime I have watched and what episode I'm on by writing in
a text file, which got annoying after a while.
This is why I created a simple program to quickly search and change a csv-file.
Is it a complete overkill to write this in C? Yes  
Could this have been a simple bash script? Definitely
But I was bored and writing C is fun.
